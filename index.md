## Overview 

This course aims to bring everyone in the Part III Systems Biology course up to speed in python which will be used as a programming language in different subsequent parts of the course. This course assumes no prior python experience, but some limited coding experience.This course may also be a good more general course for those looking to learn python for use in data science - particularly for those interested in using python with biological data 

::: {.callout-tip}
### Learning Objectives

- Present participants with the key features of python and some of the pros and cons of using python in data science
- Familiarise participants with python syntax and data types
- Introduce and explore core python programming concepts including difining functions and coding loops and conditionals
- Introduce participants to manipulating and plotting biological data in python utilising common packages
:::


### Target Audience

This is targeted at Part III Systems Biology students. All of these students should have some basic programming experience, however may not have used python.
Some participants may have taken the MCB undergraduate introduction to python course. This course will refresh and extend slightly the concepts taught in that course. 


### Prerequisites

Detail any prerequisite skills needed to attend this course, with links to other relevant materials/courses if possible.

### Exercises

Exercises in these materials are labelled according to their level of difficulty:

| Level | Description |
| ----: | :---------- |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 1 are simpler and designed to get you familiar with the concepts and syntax covered in the course. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 2 combine different concepts together and apply it to a given task. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} | Exercises in level 3 require going beyond the concepts and syntax introduced to solve new problems. |
