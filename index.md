## Overview 

This course is designed to equip all members of the Part III Systems Biology cohort at the University of Cambridge with a foundational understanding of Python, which will be utilised in various subsequent sections of the programme. While no prior knowledge of Python is required, a basic familiarity with coding is assumed. Additionally, this course may serve as a valuable introduction for those interested in learning Python for data science, particularly for those working with biological data.

### Aims

- Introduce participants to the core features of Python, emphasising its strengths and limitations in data science applications.
- Provide a comprehensive overview of Python syntax, data types, and operators.
- Cover key programming concepts in Python, including loops, conditionals, functions, and classes; alongside an introduction to the object-oriented programming paradigm.
- Discuss error handling, edge case management, memory management, code optimisation, and benchmarking.
- Introduce package installation and management, as well as environment management using pip and conda.
- Guide participants in the manipulation and visualisation of biological data using widely-used Python packages, including NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Target Audience

This course is targeted at Part III Systems Biology students at the university of Cambridge. All students attending should have some basic programming experience, however may not have used python.

Some participants may have completed the introductory Python practical in the Part II Mathematical and Computational Biology module of the Natural Sciences Tripos. This course will refresh and extend further the concepts introduced there. 


### Prerequisites

- Have some prior experience in coding whether in Python or another programming language.
- Have followed the instructions on the [Data and Setup](https://kavihshah.github.io/Intro-to-Python/setup.html) page to install python, mamba/conda, and jupyterlab.
- An understanding of biological terms (GCSE level Biology) would be beneficial.

### Exercises

Exercises in these materials are labelled according to their level of difficulty:

| Level | Description |
| ----: | :---------- |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 1 are simpler and designed to get you familiar with the concepts and syntax covered in the course. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa regular star >}} | Exercises in level 2 combine different concepts together and apply it to a given task. |
| {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} {{< fa solid star >}} | Exercises in level 3 require going beyond the concepts and syntax introduced to solve new problems. |
